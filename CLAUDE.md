# CLAUDE.md - Baby Bloom Sydney

## Efficiency Rules (READ FIRST — ALL AGENTS MUST FOLLOW)

### Context Loading Rules
Every task: Read CLAUDE.md + build-progress.md. Stop there unless task requires more.

**Bug fix:** Read ONLY the broken file. Check build-progress.md Known Bugs first.

**New page/component:** Read build-progress.md Component Registry + the closest existing page as reference. Do not read unrelated pages.

**Styling change:** Read ONLY the file being styled. No other files.

**Auth/middleware change:** Read src/lib/auth/actions.ts + src/lib/supabase/middleware.ts + src/middleware.ts. Nothing else.

**Database change:** Read docs/04-technical/database/schema.md. Nothing else from docs/.

**API/backend logic:** Read the relevant route file + schema.md if querying DB.

**Business logic features** (verification, matching, tiers): Also read docs/07-business-rules/.

**Do NOT read unless explicitly needed:**
- baby-bloom-master-blueprint.md
- baby-bloom-architecture-roadmap.md
- project-roles-and-workflow.md
- relationships.md
- best-practices-analysis.md
- Any file in docs/01-business/ or docs/02-users/
- Any file in planning/

**After completing any task:** Update build-progress.md with files created/modified.

### Response Style:
- Don't explain what you're about to do — just do it
- Don't repeat file contents back after editing — just confirm the file path and what changed
- Don't narrate your thought process — execute, then give a brief summary
- When fixing bugs, make the minimal change needed. Don't refactor surrounding code

### Agent Strategy
Classify every task before starting. Do not deliberate — pick one and go.

**Small** (1-5 files OR any bug fix):
→ Sequential. No agents. No exceptions.

**Large** (6+ new independent files):
→ Spawn 2-3 Sonnet agents. Never Opus agents.
→ No agent touches a file another agent touches.
→ Each agent reads CLAUDE.md + build-progress.md + only their files.
→ Max 3 agents. Never more.
→ Before spawning, verify enough context window remains for all agents to complete. If unsure, go sequential.

**Always sequential regardless of size:**
- Bug fixes
- Refactoring
- Anything touching shared files (auth, layouts, utilities, types)
- Any task where step order matters
- Database changes

**Agent failure recovery:**
If any agent fails or creates a conflict, stop all agents. Continue sequentially from the last working state.

### Dependency Awareness:
- Before creating any new component, check the Component Registry in build-progress.md
- Before installing any package, check if it's already in package.json
- Before creating utility functions, check src/lib/ for existing ones
- Don't create duplicate files — check first

### Compaction Protocol:
- Monitor context usage throughout the session
- Compact proactively at logical breakpoints — after completing each major task, not mid-task
- BEFORE every compact, update ALL of:
  - This CLAUDE.md (if project state changed — new phase, new decisions)
  - docs/04-technical/build-progress.md with:
    - Files created (full paths)
    - Files modified (full paths + what changed)
    - Current bugs/issues
    - Updated component registry
    - Exact next task to pick up
- Never compact mid-task. Finish the current logical unit first
- The build-progress.md file must always reflect the true current state so any new context window can resume perfectly

## Project Overview
Baby Bloom Sydney is a nanny matching platform for Sydney, Australia. We're rebuilding it from a manual Wix + Google Sheets system into a modern automated web app with AI-powered features.

**Tech Stack:** Next.js 14 (App Router), Supabase (PostgreSQL + Auth + Storage), OpenAI API (GPT-4o), Cloudinary (images), Vercel (hosting)

---

## Architecture Summary

### Database: 23 Tables across 6 domains (DEPLOYED to Supabase)

**Core Identity (2 tables + auth.users):**
- `auth.users` - Supabase Auth managed (not in public schema)
- `user_roles` - nanny, parent, admin
- `user_profiles` - shared data (name, email, location, profile pic)

**Nanny Domain (7 tables):**
- `nannies` - profile, experience, rates, status, verification tier
- `nanny_availability` - weekly schedule (JSONB)
- `nanny_credentials` - qualifications + certifications
- `nanny_assurances` - police checks, references
- `nanny_images` - ad images (Cloudinary URLs)
- `nanny_ai_content` - AI-generated bios, Facebook posts
- `verifications` - WWCC + passport verification tracking

**Parent Domain (4 tables):**
- `parents` - family info, current_nanny_id
- `nanny_positions` - open positions (ONE active per parent, enforced by unique index)
- `position_schedule` - weekly needs (JSONB)
- `position_children` - 1-3 children, ages stored in months (INTEGER)

**Matching & Requests (5 tables):**
- `interview_requests` - parent → nanny interview coordination
- `babysitting_requests` - one-time jobs
- `bsr_time_slots` - multiple time slots per babysitting request
- `bsr_notifications` - 20 closest nannies notified per job
- `nanny_placements` - hired nanny tracking (permanent record)

**Reference & Logs (5 tables):**
- `sydney_postcodes` - 194 suburbs with lat/lng for geolocation (SEEDED)
- `activity_logs` - complete audit trail
- `email_logs` - all system emails
- `user_progress` - funnel tracking
- `file_retention_log` - 5-year file deletion tracking

---

## Key Business Rules

### Verification Tiers (enforced by computed columns):
- **Tier 1:** Profile created → `profile_visible = true`
- **Tier 2:** WWCC + Passport verified → `visible_in_match_making = true`
- **Tier 3:** Facebook post verified → `visible_in_bsr = true`

### Constraints:
- ONE active position per parent (unique index)
- ONE active placement per parent (unique index)
- WWCC expiry auto-disables via daily cron → `wwcc_verified = false`
- File retention: 5 years after account deactivation, then auto-delete

### Matching Algorithm:
**Regular Matching (nanny positions):**
- Hard filters: availability overlap, location proximity, child age experience
- Weighted scoring: Rate 30%, Experience 25%, Qualifications 20%, Skills 15%, Other 10%

**Babysitting Matching (one-time jobs):**
- Find all Tier 3 nannies available at requested time
- Calculate distance using sydney_postcodes lat/lng
- Select 20 closest, notify all simultaneously
- First to accept wins (timestamp determines)

## Database Design Decisions
- CITEXT for email fields (case-insensitive)
- UUID primary keys on all tables
- Child ages as INTEGER in months (0-180+)
- Merged qualifications + certifications into single `nanny_credentials` table
- Computed columns enforce business rules (visibility flags)
- Nanny placements have bidirectional references (parent.current_nanny_id ↔ nanny.current_placement_id)
- Partial indexes on active records only (performance)
- GIN indexes on JSONB columns (availability schedules)
- Foreign key cascades for referential integrity
- `updated_at` auto-update triggers on every table
- `placement_duration_days` computed only when ended (NULL while active - PG17 immutability requirement)

## User Journeys

### Nanny Flow:
Signup (40 fields) → AI bio generated → Profile live (Tier 1) → Upload passport + WWCC → AI verifies → Tier 2 → Share AI-generated Facebook post → Upload screenshot → Tier 3 → Receive interview requests → Get hired → Placement tracked → Available for babysitting jobs

### Parent Flow:
Browse nannies publicly → Signup → See availability calendars → Create position (42-field form, ONE at a time) → See matched nannies → Request interview (pick 3 times) → AI emails nanny → Interview → Hire → Placement created → Can also post babysitting requests

### Admin Flow:
Monitor signups → Review/override AI verifications → Handle disputes → Track conversion metrics

---

## AI Integration Points
- **Provider:** OpenAI API (GPT-4o) — client at `app/src/lib/ai/client.ts`
- **Content generation:** Nanny bios (from 40-field form), Facebook posts (viral growth), interview emails
- **Verification:** Passport photo matching, WWCC document parsing, Facebook screenshot validation
- **Coordination:** Email sequencing (request → accept → confirm → remind), calendar invite generation

## Database Deployment Status

### Supabase Project
- **Project Ref:** umkqevipzmoovyrnynrf
- **Region:** ap-northeast-1 (Tokyo)
- **PostgreSQL:** 17.6
- **Pooler:** aws-1-ap-northeast-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432

### Deployed Files (in order):
1. `supabase-setup.sql` — 23 tables, 7 functions, triggers, indexes, constraints (235 commands)
2. `rls-policies.sql` — RLS enabled on all 23 tables, helper functions, protection triggers, granular policies (253 commands)
3. `seed.sql` — 194 Sydney postcodes seeded (test user data requires auth users to be created first)

### Deployment Fixes Applied:
- `placement_duration_days` generated column: removed `now()` (not immutable in PG17), computes only when `ended_at` is set
- Verification block table count: corrected from 24 to 23 (auth.users is in auth schema, not public)

## Code Style & Conventions
- PostgreSQL with Supabase extensions (uuid-ossp, citext, pg_trgm)
- SQL: lowercase keywords, snake_case table/column names
- Use `TIMESTAMPTZ` for all timestamps (UTC)
- All tables get: `id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid()`, `created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()`, `updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()`
- Use `REFERENCES` with `ON DELETE` clauses for all foreign keys
- Comment all tables and complex columns in SQL
- TypeScript strict mode
- React Server Components by default, 'use client' only when needed
- shadcn/ui for all UI components — check Component Registry before creating custom ones
