# Row Level Security (RLS) Policies

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** 2026-02-05
**Status:** 📋 Ready for Implementation

---

## Overview

This document defines Row Level Security (RLS) policies for all 24 tables in the Baby Bloom Sydney database. RLS ensures users can only access data they're authorized to see, enforced at the database level.

### Why RLS?

- **Defense in Depth:** Security enforced at database level, not just API
- **Zero Trust:** Even if API is bypassed, data remains protected
- **Supabase Native:** Integrates seamlessly with Supabase Auth
- **Audit Ready:** Compliance with data protection requirements

---

## Role Definitions

### 1. Public (Unauthenticated)
- No access to any data
- Must authenticate to access platform

### 2. Nanny
- Full access to own profile and related data
- Read access to verified nanny profiles (for reference)
- Read access to babysitting requests they're notified about
- No access to parent data (except via approved requests)

### 3. Parent
- Full access to own profile and positions
- Read access to verified nanny profiles for matching
- Full access to own interview/babysitting requests
- No access to other parent data

### 4. Admin
- Full read access to all data
- Write access to verification and status fields
- Cannot modify user personal data directly
- All actions logged

### 5. Super Admin
- Full access to everything
- Can modify system settings
- Can delete/restore users

---

## Policy Implementation Pattern

Each policy follows this pattern:

```sql
-- Enable RLS on table
ALTER TABLE table_name ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Force RLS for table owner (recommended)
ALTER TABLE table_name FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create policies
CREATE POLICY "policy_name" ON table_name
  FOR [SELECT|INSERT|UPDATE|DELETE|ALL]
  TO [authenticated|anon|role_name]
  USING (condition)
  WITH CHECK (condition);
```

---

## Helper Functions

Before implementing policies, create these helper functions:

```sql
-- ============================================================================
-- RLS HELPER FUNCTIONS
-- ============================================================================

-- Get current user's role
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION auth.user_role()
RETURNS TEXT AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN (
    SELECT role FROM user_roles
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
  );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Check if user is a nanny
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION auth.is_nanny()
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN auth.user_role() = 'nanny';
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Check if user is a parent
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION auth.is_parent()
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN auth.user_role() = 'parent';
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Check if user is admin or super_admin
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION auth.is_admin()
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN auth.user_role() IN ('admin', 'super_admin');
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Check if user is super_admin
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION auth.is_super_admin()
RETURNS BOOLEAN AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN auth.user_role() = 'super_admin';
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Get nanny_id for current user
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION auth.nanny_id()
RETURNS UUID AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN (
    SELECT id FROM nannies
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
  );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

-- Get parent_id for current user
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION auth.parent_id()
RETURNS UUID AS $$
BEGIN
  RETURN (
    SELECT id FROM parents
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
  );
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;
```

## Policies by Table

### 1. user_roles

```sql
ALTER TABLE user_roles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE user_roles FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Users can read their own role
CREATE POLICY "Users can read own role"
  ON user_roles FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (user_id = auth.uid());

-- Only super_admin can modify roles
CREATE POLICY "Super admin can manage roles"
  ON user_roles FOR ALL
  TO authenticated
  USING (auth.is_super_admin())
  WITH CHECK (auth.is_super_admin());

-- Service role for initial signup (handled by trigger)
```

---

### 2. user_profiles

```sql
ALTER TABLE user_profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
ALTER TABLE user_profiles FORCE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Users can read and update own profile
CREATE POLICY "Users can read own profile"
  ON user_profiles FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (user_id = auth.uid());

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile"
  ON user_profiles FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (user_id = auth.uid())
  WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid());

-- Users can insert their own profile (during signup)
CREATE POLICY "Users can create own profile"
  ON user_profiles FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid());

-- Parents can read nanny profiles (for matching)
-- Nannies can read parent profiles (for interview requests)
CREATE POLICY "Parents can read verified nanny profiles"
  ON user_profiles FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    auth.is_parent() AND
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM nannies n
      WHERE n.user_id = user_profiles.user_id
      AND n.visible_in_match_making = true
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY "Nannies can read requesting parents"
  ON user_profiles FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (
    auth.is_nanny() AND
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM interview_requests ir
      JOIN parents p ON ir.parent_id = p.id
      WHERE p.user_id = user_profiles.user_id
      AND ir.nanny_id = auth.nanny_id()

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Scenarios

1. **Nanny Self-Access**
   - ✅ Can read own profile
   - ✅ Can update own profile
   - ❌ Cannot modify verification status
   - ❌ Cannot read other nanny's unverified data

2. **Parent Matching Access**
   - ✅ Can read verified nanny profiles
   - ✅ Can read approved images
   - ❌ Cannot read unverified nanny data
   - ❌ Cannot read other parent data

3. **Cross-Role Protection**
   - ❌ Nanny cannot read parent positions (unless requested)
   - ❌ Parent cannot read nanny verifications
   - ❌ Neither can access admin-only tables

4. **Admin Capabilities**
   - ✅ Can read all data
   - ✅ Can update verification status
   - ✅ Can manage placements
   - ❌ Cannot delete user personal data (audit trail)

## Security Notes

### Best Practices Implemented

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**
   - Users only see data they need
   - Write access limited to own data
   - Verification fields protected

2. **Defense in Depth**
   - RLS + API validation
   - Cannot bypass via direct DB access
   - Service role for system operations

3. **Audit Trail**
   - All actions logged
   - Logs cannot be modified by users
   - Admin actions tracked

### Potential Risks Mitigated

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Self-verification | Check constraints prevent nannies from verifying themselves |
| Data enumeration | Partial indexes limit visible records |
| Cross-tenant access | Foreign key checks in USING clauses |
| Privilege escalation | Role changes require super_admin |

---

## Maintenance

### Regular Review Tasks

1. **Monthly:** Audit policy effectiveness
2. **Quarterly:** Review access patterns in logs
3. **Annually:** Security assessment
4. **On Change:** Update policies when schema changes

### Performance Considerations

- Helper functions use SECURITY DEFINER for efficiency
- Policies use indexed columns where possible
- Complex conditions broken into multiple policies
- EXISTS subqueries for relationship checks
