## Search Algorithm

### Ranking Factors

| Factor | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Location match | 30% | Distance from parent's suburb |
| Availability match | 25% | Overlap with parent's needs |
| Profile completeness | 15% | More complete = higher rank |
| Verification status | 15% | Verified nannies rank higher |
| Rating & reviews | 10% | Higher ratings rank higher |
| Response rate | 5% | Active nannies rank higher |

### Scoring Formula
```
score = (location_score * 0.30) +
        (availability_score * 0.25) +
        (completeness_score * 0.15) +
        (verification_score * 0.15) +
        (rating_score * 0.10) +
        (activity_score * 0.05)
```

### Boosting Rules
| Condition | Boost |
|-----------|-------|
| WWCC verified | +10% |
| Profile photo present | +5% |
| Responded in last 24h | +5% |
| New nanny (< 30 days) | +5% (new nanny boost) |

### Filtering Rules
