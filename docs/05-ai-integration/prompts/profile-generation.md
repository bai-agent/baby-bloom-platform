## Example Output

```
Hi, I'm Sarah! With four years of experience caring for infants and toddlers,
I've developed a deep understanding of what little ones need during their
most formative years.

I hold a Certificate III in Early Childhood Education, along with current
First Aid and CPR certifications. My background includes specialised training
in sleep routines and Montessori-inspired learning methods, which I find
wonderful for encouraging independence and curiosity in young children.

One thing parents often appreciate is my ability to incorporate music into
daily activities—I play guitar and love using songs to make learning fun,
whether we're practicing counting or winding down before naptime.

I'm also conversational in Spanish, which can be a lovely way to introduce
bilingual exposure naturally through play and everyday interactions.

What draws me to this work is the privilege of witnessing those amazing
developmental milestones—first words, first steps, the way a toddler's
face lights up when they master something new.

I'm available for regular care as well as overnight arrangements for families
who need that flexibility. I'd love to chat about how I might be a great fit
for your family!
