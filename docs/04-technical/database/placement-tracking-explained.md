# Nanny Placement Tracking - Complete Addition

**Date:** 2026-02-05
**Status:** ✅ ADDED TO SCHEMA v3.0

---

## WHAT WE ADDED

### 1. New Table: `nanny_placements`

**Purpose:** Track every successful hire between nanny and parent

**Key Fields:**
- `nanny_id` + `parent_id` - The connection
- `source` - How they found each other (interview_request, babysitting_job, direct_hire, referral)
- `interview_request_id` / `babysitting_request_id` - Link back to original request
- `status` - active, ended, paused
- `hired_at` / `ended_at` - Placement lifecycle
- `end_reason` + `end_notes` - Why placement ended
- `placement_duration_days` - Computed field (auto-calculated)
- Satisfaction ratings (parent & nanny) - Future reviews

**Business Rules Enforced:**
- ✅ Only ONE active placement per parent (unique index)
- ✅ Nannies can have multiple active placements (part-time families)
- ✅ Prevents duplicate active placements (nanny + parent combo)

---

### 2. Reference Columns Added

#### In `nannies` table:
```sql
current_placement_id UUID REFERENCES nanny_placements(id)
```
- Quick lookup: "Which parent(s) is this nanny currently working for?"
- NULL when nanny has no current placement

#### In `parents` table:
```sql
current_nanny_id UUID REFERENCES nannies(id)
current_placement_id UUID REFERENCES nanny_placements(id)
```
- Quick lookup: "Who is this parent's current nanny?"
- Both NULL when parent has no hired nanny

**Why Both Directions?**
- Fast queries without joins
- Clear at-a-glance status
- Maintains referential integrity

---

### 3. Activity Logs Enhanced

Added placement-related action types:
- `placement_created` - When nanny hired
- `placement_ended` - When placement ends
- `placement_paused` - Temporarily paused
- `placement_resumed` - Reactivated

**Full History Preserved:**
Even though `nanny_placements` tracks the "current state," `activity_logs` preserves:
- Every hire event
- Every placement end with reason
- Duration and satisfaction
- Who recorded it (admin or system)

---

### 4. Email Logs Enhanced

Added placement-related email types:
- `placement_created` - Confirmation emails
- `placement_ended` - Thank you / feedback emails

---

### 5. User Progress Enhanced

Added placement-related stages:
- `nanny_first_hire` - First time nanny gets hired
- `parent_first_hire` - First time parent successfully hires

**Funnel Tracking:**
Now you can track conversion from:
- Signup → Profile → Verification → Interview → **HIRE** ✅

## HOW IT WORKS

### When Parent Hires Nanny:

```sql
-- 1. Create placement record
INSERT INTO nanny_placements (
  nanny_id,
  parent_id,
  position_id,
  source,
  interview_request_id,
  status,
  hired_at
) VALUES (
  'nanny_uuid',
  'parent_uuid',
  'position_uuid',
  'interview_request',
  'interview_request_uuid',
  'active',
  NOW()
);

-- 2. Update nanny reference
UPDATE nannies
SET current_placement_id = 'placement_uuid'
WHERE id = 'nanny_uuid';

-- 3. Update parent references
UPDATE parents
SET
  current_nanny_id = 'nanny_uuid',
  current_placement_id = 'placement_uuid'
WHERE id = 'parent_uuid';

-- 4. Log to activity_logs
INSERT INTO activity_logs (user_id, action_type, action_details)
VALUES (
  'nanny_user_id',
  'placement_created',
  jsonb_build_object(
    'placement_id', 'placement_uuid',
    'parent_id', 'parent_uuid',
    'source', 'interview_request'
  )
);

-- 5. Track funnel progress
INSERT INTO user_progress (user_id, stage)
VALUES ('nanny_user_id', 'nanny_first_hire')
ON CONFLICT (user_id, stage) DO NOTHING;

INSERT INTO user_progress (user_id, stage)
VALUES ('parent_user_id', 'parent_first_hire')
ON CONFLICT (user_id, stage) DO NOTHING;

-- 6. Send confirmation emails
INSERT INTO email_logs (recipient_user_id, email_type, subject, status)
VALUES
  ('nanny_user_id', 'placement_created', 'Congratulations! You''ve been hired', 'queued'),
  ('parent_user_id', 'placement_created', 'Your new nanny starts soon', 'queued');
```

---

### When Placement Ends:

```sql
-- 1. Update placement record
UPDATE nanny_placements
SET
  status = 'ended',
  ended_at = NOW(),
  end_reason = 'parent_no_longer_needs',
  end_notes = 'Child started school',
  parent_satisfaction_rating = 5,
  nanny_satisfaction_rating = 5,
  would_rehire = true,
  would_work_again = true
WHERE id = 'placement_uuid';

-- 2. Clear nanny reference
UPDATE nannies
SET current_placement_id = NULL
WHERE id = 'nanny_uuid';

-- 3. Clear parent references
UPDATE parents
SET
  current_nanny_id = NULL,
  current_placement_id = NULL
WHERE id = 'parent_uuid';

-- 4. Log to activity_logs
INSERT INTO activity_logs (user_id, action_type, action_details)
VALUES (
  'nanny_user_id',
  'placement_ended',
  jsonb_build_object(
    'placement_id', 'placement_uuid',
    'parent_id', 'parent_uuid',
    'duration_days', 180,
    'end_reason', 'parent_no_longer_needs',
    'satisfaction_rating', 5
  )
);
```

## POWERFUL QUERIES ENABLED

### 1. Current Status Lookup

**Find parent's current nanny:**
```sql
SELECT n.*, p.hired_at as working_since
FROM nannies n
JOIN parents p ON p.current_nanny_id = n.id
JOIN nanny_placements np ON np.id = p.current_placement_id
WHERE p.id = 'parent_uuid';
```

**Find nanny's current parents:**
```sql
SELECT p.*, np.hired_at as working_since
FROM parents p
WHERE p.current_nanny_id = 'nanny_uuid';
```

### 2. Complete History

**Nanny's placement history:**
```sql
SELECT
  np.*,
  up.first_name || ' ' || up.last_name as parent_name,
  np.placement_duration_days,
  np.end_reason,
  np.parent_satisfaction_rating
FROM nanny_placements np
JOIN parents p ON np.parent_id = p.id
JOIN user_profiles up ON p.user_id = up.user_id
WHERE np.nanny_id = 'nanny_uuid'
ORDER BY np.hired_at DESC;
```

**Parent's nanny history:**
```sql
SELECT
  np.*,
  up.first_name || ' ' || up.last_name as nanny_name,
  np.placement_duration_days,
  np.end_reason,
  np.nanny_satisfaction_rating
FROM nanny_placements np
JOIN nannies n ON np.nanny_id = n.id
JOIN user_profiles up ON n.user_id = up.user_id
WHERE np.parent_id = 'parent_uuid'
ORDER BY np.hired_at DESC;
```

### 3. Platform Success Metrics

**Average placement duration:**
```sql
SELECT
  ROUND(AVG(placement_duration_days)) as avg_days,
  ROUND(AVG(placement_duration_days) / 30.0, 1) as avg_months
FROM nanny_placements
WHERE status = 'ended';
```

**Placement success by source:**
```sql
SELECT
  source,
  COUNT(*) as total_placements,
  ROUND(AVG(placement_duration_days)) as avg_days,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE placement_duration_days > 90) as long_term_placements,
  ROUND(AVG(parent_satisfaction_rating), 1) as avg_parent_satisfaction,
  ROUND(AVG(nanny_satisfaction_rating), 1) as avg_nanny_satisfaction
FROM nanny_placements
WHERE status = 'ended'
GROUP BY source;
```

**Interview → Hire conversion rate:**
```sql
SELECT
  COUNT(DISTINCT ir.id) as total_interviews,
  COUNT(DISTINCT np.id) as total_hires,
  ROUND(
    100.0 * COUNT(DISTINCT np.id) / NULLIF(COUNT(DISTINCT ir.id), 0),
    1
  ) as conversion_rate_percent
FROM interview_requests ir
LEFT JOIN nanny_placements np ON np.interview_request_id = ir.id;
```

**Top performing nannies:**
```sql
SELECT
  up.first_name || ' ' || up.last_name as nanny_name,
  COUNT(np.id) as total_placements,
  ROUND(AVG(np.placement_duration_days)) as avg_duration_days,
  ROUND(AVG(np.parent_satisfaction_rating), 1) as avg_rating,
  COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE np.would_rehire = true) as would_rehire_count
FROM nannies n
JOIN user_profiles up ON n.user_id = up.user_id
JOIN nanny_placements np ON np.nanny_id = n.id
WHERE np.status = 'ended'
GROUP BY n.id, up.first_name, up.last_name
HAVING COUNT(np.id) >= 3
ORDER BY avg_rating DESC, avg_duration_days DESC
LIMIT 20;
```
