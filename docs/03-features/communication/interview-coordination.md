## Coordination Flow

### Step 1: Parent Initiates
Parent indicates interest in interviewing a nanny
- From nanny profile: "Request Interview"
- From application: "Schedule Interview"

### Step 2: AI Gathers Availability
```
1. System checks nanny's calendar availability
        ↓
2. System checks parent's preferences
        ↓
3. AI suggests 3-5 optimal time slots
        ↓
4. Parent selects preferred times
```

### Step 3: AI Sends Request
AI composes and sends email to nanny:
- Personalized message
- Available time slots
- Interview type options
- Easy response mechanism

### Step 4: Nanny Responds
- Selects time slot
- Confirms interview type
- Adds any notes

### Step 5: Confirmation
- Both parties notified
- Calendar invites sent
- Reminders scheduled

Hi Sarah,

The Smith family in Bondi is interested in meeting you

They're available to meet at these times:
• Tuesday, March 12 at 10:00 AM
• Wednesday, March 13 at 2:00 PM
• Thursday, March 14 at 11:00 AM

Would any of these work for you? You can also suggest
alternative times.

Best regards,
Baby Bloom Sydney
