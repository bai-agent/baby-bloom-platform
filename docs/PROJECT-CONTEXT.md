# Baby Bloom Sydney — Comprehensive Project Context

**Last Updated:** 2026-02-18
**Author:** Bailey (Founder) + Claude Code
**Purpose:** Full context document for continuing development across sessions

---

## 1. VISION & END RESULT

### What We're Building
Baby Bloom Sydney is a **free AI-powered nanny matching platform** for Sydney, Australia. It replaces a manual system (Wix website + Google Sheets + Make.com automations) with a modern, automated web app.

### The End Product
A fully automated platform where:
- **Nannies** create professional profiles via a guided form, get AI-generated bios, verify their identity, and receive interview requests and babysitting jobs — all without manual admin work
- **Parents** browse verified nannies, create nanny positions with detailed requirements, get AI-matched nanny recommendations, request interviews, and post one-time babysitting jobs
- **Admins** monitor the pipeline, review AI verification decisions, handle edge cases, and track metrics — but 95% of operations are automated by AI

### Why It's Free
Baby Bloom is a **lead magnet** for a future premium product: an EYLF-based educational tracking app for parents. The matching platform builds trust and a user base. Competitors charge $400–$1,200 for nanny placement — Baby Bloom charges $0.

### Future Revenue (Out of Current Scope)
1. Parent subscriptions to the educational tracking app
2. Nanny commissions on parent signups they facilitate
3. Optional training bundles (Baby Bloom trains nannies in child development)

### Geographic Scope
Sydney suburbs only. 194 suburbs seeded with lat/lng coordinates for geolocation matching.

## 3. USER ROLES & JOURNEYS

### 3.1 Nanny Journey (3 Tiers)

**Tier 1 — Profile Created:**
- Signs up → fills 9-step registration form (~40 fields) → AI generates professional bio
- Profile visible publicly but CANNOT receive interview or babysitting requests

**Tier 2 — Identity Verified:**
- Uploads passport photo → AI verifies (name, photo match, not expired)
- Uploads WWCC details → AI extracts info → Admin verifies via NSW portal
- Unlocks: Can receive interview requests from parents

**Tier 3 — Fully Verified:**
- AI generates a Facebook post script with link to their Baby Bloom profile
- Nanny shares to Facebook parenting/nanny groups, uploads screenshot
- AI verifies screenshot (name, content, link, group)
- Unlocks: Full babysitting pool access (notified of nearby jobs)

**Receiving Opportunities:**
- Interview Requests: Email with parent info + 3 proposed times → nanny picks one → calendar invites sent
- Babysitting: Notified when in closest 20 nannies to a job → first to accept wins

### 3.2 Parent Journey (3 Tiers)

**Tier 1 — Basic Account:**
- Signs up → can browse nanny profiles and see availability calendars
- Cannot request interviews

**Tier 2 — Open Nanny Position:**
- Fills 5-step nanny request form (preferences, schedule, children, requirements)
- ONE active position at a time (database constraint)
- Can request interviews with nannies (pick 3 time slots)
- AI coordinates scheduling via email

**Tier 3 — Babysitting:**
- Posts babysitting request (up to 7 time slots)
- First time: must verify ID (photo ID upload → admin reviews → address shared with nanny)
- System finds 20 closest Tier 3 nannies, notifies all simultaneously
- First nanny to accept wins

### 3.3 Admin
- Monitor signups, review AI verification decisions (approve/override/reject)
- Handle edge cases, disputes, email bounces
- Track conversion metrics across the funnel
- Quality control: spot-check AI bios, audit verification accuracy

## 4. DATABASE — 23 Tables (All Deployed to Supabase)

### Core Identity
| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `user_roles` | Maps auth.users → role (nanny/parent/admin/super_admin) |
| `user_profiles` | Shared profile data (name, email, mobile, location, picture) |
| `verifications` | WWCC + passport verification tracking, status, rejection reasons |

### Nanny Domain
| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `nannies` | Main nanny entity (~50 columns): experience, preferences, rates, status, verification tier, computed visibility flags |
| `nanny_availability` | Weekly schedule (JSONB), days available |
| `nanny_credentials` | Qualifications + certifications (merged table) |
| `nanny_assurances` | Police checks, references |
| `nanny_images` | Cloudinary image URLs for ads/gallery |
| `nanny_ai_content` | AI-generated bios, headlines, pitches |
| `sydney_postcodes` | 194 suburbs with lat/lng (seeded reference data) |

### Parent Domain
| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `parents` | Main parent entity: family info, current nanny/placement refs |
| `nanny_positions` | Open positions (ONE active per parent — unique index) |
| `position_schedule` | Weekly schedule requirements (JSONB) |
| `position_children` | 1-3 children per position (age in months, gender, label A/B/C) |

### Matching & Requests
| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `interview_requests` | Parent→nanny interview coordination (proposed times, status, outcome) |
| `babysitting_requests` | One-time jobs (location, rate, status, ratings) |
| `bsr_time_slots` | Multiple time slots per babysitting request |
| `bsr_notifications` | 20 closest nannies notified per job (tracks acceptance) |
| `nanny_placements` | Hired nanny tracking (permanent record, satisfaction ratings) |

### Reference & Logs
| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `user_progress` | Funnel stage tracking (signup → tier upgrades → first hire) |
| `activity_logs` | Complete audit trail (30+ action types) |
| `email_logs` | All system emails (status, provider response) |
| `file_retention_log` | 5-year file deletion tracking (GDPR compliance) |

### Key Computed Columns on `nannies`:
- `fully_verified` = `wwcc_verified AND identity_verified`
- `visible_in_match_making` = `status = 'active' AND wwcc_verified AND identity_verified`
- `visible_in_bsr` = same as match_making (Tier 3 check done at query time)
- `profile_visible` = `status IN ('active', 'pending_verification')`

### Key Constraints:
- ONE active position per parent (unique partial index)
- ONE active placement per parent (unique partial index)
- WWCC expiry auto-disables via daily cron
- File retention: 5 years after account deactivation

### Deployed SQL Files:
1. `docs/04-technical/database/supabase-setup.sql` — 23 tables, 7 functions, triggers, indexes (235 commands)
2. `docs/04-technical/database/rls-policies.sql` — RLS on all 23 tables, helper functions, granular policies (253 commands)
3. `docs/04-technical/database/seed.sql` — 194 Sydney postcodes with lat/lng

---

## 5. AI INTEGRATION POINTS

### Implemented:
- **Nanny Bio Generation** (`lib/actions/nanny.ts` → `generateNannyBio`): GPT-4o generates 150-250 word professional bio from form data. Third person, warm but professional. Fires in background after profile creation.

### Designed (Prompts Written, Not Yet Wired):
- **Passport Verification** (`docs/05-ai-integration/prompts/passport-verification.md`): Extract document data, detect tampering, check expiry, return confidence score + recommendation (APPROVE/MANUAL_REVIEW/REJECT). Thresholds: 95%+ auto-approve, 70-94% manual review, <70% reject.
- **WWCC Verification** (`docs/05-ai-integration/prompts/wwcc-verification.md`): Extract WWCC number from card photo, validate format (`WWC` + 7 digits + P/V), check card type (Paid only, not Volunteer). Assists admin manual check via NSW portal.
- **Email Coordination** (`docs/05-ai-integration/prompts/email-coordination.md`): Generate personalized interview request emails, confirmation emails, and reminder emails. Under 200 words, warm professional tone.
- **Facebook Post Generation**: AI generates viral-style post scripts for nannies to share. Not yet documented in detail.

### Phase 3.5: Form Rebuild to Match Wix Specs — COMPLETE (Current Session)

All 3 forms rebuilt as multi-step funnels matching the original Wix form specifications exactly:

#### Nanny Registration Form (9 steps + review)
**Route:** `/nanny/register`
**Funnel:** `NannyRegistrationFunnel.tsx` — `NannyRegistrationData` interface
**Steps:**
1. **StepIntro** — Welcome page, "Create your nanny profile" + Start button
2. **StepExperience** — 4 experience dropdowns (0-10+) + details textarea, progressive reveal
3. **StepQualifications** — Qualification dropdown → assurances tags → certificates tags, progressive reveal
4. **StepPreferences** — Role types → support level → max children → age range → additional needs, progressive reveal
5. **StepAvailability** — Days multi-select → per-day time slots → start timing → placement duration
6. **StepSalary** — Hourly rate tags ($35/$40/$45/$50) → pay frequency tags
7. **StepHelpfulInfo** — DOB → 18+ check → languages → license → car → pets → vaccination → non-smoker, progressive reveal
8. **StepResidency** — Nationality dropdown (~170 countries) → conditional residency status → right to work → Sydney resident → suburb/postcode
9. **StepAboutYou** — 3 textareas + photo upload + confirmation checkbox
10. **StepReview** — 8 section cards displaying all data, submit button

**Server Action:** `createNannyProfile()` in `lib/actions/nanny.ts` — transforms form data → DB format, triggers AI bio generation

#### Parent Nanny Request Form (5 steps)
**Route:** `/parent/request`
**Funnel:** `ParentRequestFunnel.tsx` — `ParentRequestData` interface
**Steps:**
1. **StepPlacement** — Urgency tags, start date, placement length tags, conditional end date

## 9. KEY DESIGN PATTERNS

### Form Pattern: Multi-Step Funnel
- `FunnelProgress` component shows step indicators (mobile: dots, desktop: labeled steps)
- Each step is a separate component receiving `StepProps` (data, updateData, goNext, goBack)
- Progressive reveal: fields appear one-by-one as previous fields are answered
- Tag/pill UI for single-select and multi-select (violet selected, slate unselected)
- Conditional rendering based on answers (e.g., residency status only shows if not Australian)
- Dev mode: `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEV_MODE=true` pre-fills mock data, bypasses auth

### Form Pattern: Tabbed Editor
- Used for editing existing profiles/positions (NannyProfileForm, PositionForm)
- All sections visible via tabs, save button per section

### Auth Pattern
- Supabase Auth handles signup/login
- `createAdminClient()` bypasses RLS for post-signup inserts
- Middleware protects routes by role
- Dev mode bypasses all auth

### Component Conventions
- Named exports only (not default)
- `"use client"` only when needed
- shadcn/ui components in `src/components/ui/`
- Violet (#8B5CF6) primary color throughout

## 10. WHAT'S NOT BUILT YET (Remaining Work)

### High Priority (Makes Forms Functional)
1. **Wire Parent Request form to Supabase** — create server action for `/parent/request`
2. **Wire ID Verification form to Supabase** — create server action for `/nanny/verify`, write to `verifications` table
3. **File uploads to Supabase Storage** — passport photos, WWCC docs, profile pictures (currently just storing file names)

### Medium Priority (Core Platform Features)
4. **Nanny detail page** — full profile view for parents at `/nannies/[id]` (exists but may need enhancement)
5. **Matching algorithm** — weighted scoring for nanny positions, geolocation for babysitting
6. **Babysitting request flow** — create/accept/notify cycle, 20-closest-nannies logic
7. **Email notifications** — interview requests, confirmations, reminders, babysitting alerts (prompts designed, sending not implemented)
8. **AI verification flows** — passport photo analysis, WWCC document parsing, Facebook screenshot validation (prompts designed, not wired)

### Lower Priority (Polish & Scale)
9. **Facebook post generation** — AI creates viral post scripts for nannies
10. **Facebook screenshot verification** — Tier 3 unlock flow
11. **Parent ID verification for babysitting** — admin review flow
12. **WWCC expiry monitoring** — daily cron alerts at 30/7/0 days
13. **Position auto-close** — 30+ day inactivity detection + AI email
14. **Calendar invite generation** — for confirmed interviews
15. **Activity logging** — write to activity_logs on all actions
16. **Admin verification queue** — review AI decisions, approve/override/reject
17. **Admin user management** — suspend/reinstate users
18. **Visual polish** — form styling refinement, responsive tweaks, loading states

### Out of Current Scope
- Educational tracking app (future product)
- Payment system
- Geographic expansion beyond Sydney
- Mobile app
